# simple-javascript-background-slider
a simple javascript way to add different images and let them change per seconds
So i wanted to create a temporary coming soon page and have the background images change after some seconds without using jquery or some complex plugins.
I came up with this few lines of code
you can use php/python/asp/html as you choose
just include the javascript and you are good to go
